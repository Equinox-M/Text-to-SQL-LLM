# Text-to-SQL Gemini App

## Overview
This project aims to provide a streamlined solution for converting English questions into SQL queries using Google's Generative AI (Gemini). With this app, users can input natural language questions related to a hypothetical student database and receive corresponding SQL queries. Additionally, the app displays query results if applicable.[Preview](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Equinox-M/Text-To-SQL-Gemini-Model)
